Spawned at the center of a simple, familiar home!
A barren studio apartment, though with leviathan furnishings
As you stand at the height of a gnome!


Simple green paint strikes towering walls,
Cupboards stretch, atop a maple-rugged floor.
Trotting around, you can confirm there’s no halls
Yet one end of the room presents an iron-clad door!

Across from the door is but a nice, homely kitchen,
Bearing a fridge, microwave and glass-protected stove.
And off to the side, somewhat out of place in this den,
Is an oversized chest, nestled neat in an alcove!

The room’s centerpiece: a mahogany desk, 
Far too tall to ascend, climb or conquer!
Its size, like the rest, is simply elephant-esque,
If only you were simply just slightly taller!

Upon the ground now lies four varied objects.
First, a nugget, scattered afar from a toe.
Then there’s some candy, yes, edible trinkets.
Amidst all, an hourglass, courtesy of sentient plateau.):Table convulses!\nIt reels back, mouth opening!\nSpits things into room.",
