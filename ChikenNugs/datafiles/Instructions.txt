World file has a list of all possible commands that will be used and it has intro sequences
FOR ALL FILES - DO NOT PUT COMMENTS IN THEM (///)

General JSON Rules
Always label fields with ""
Group things that are related in {}
Separate different objects with , (i.e "syntax": "hi", "proper":"syntax"

STRING EFFECTS (3/12):
You can write a string with certain effects
	Codes:
		0: Base (nothing special)
		1: shaking text
		2: wavey text
		3: shifting colors
		4: wavey + shifting colors
		5: spinning text
		6: pulsing text
		7: flickering text

Syntax example: <1>Hello<0> -- Hello will be drawn in shaking text 

To execute multiple instructions for an interaction separate each with '/'

Always end the string with <0> to reset the effect or else everything until the next effect will be drawn with the previous effect
 - <1>Hello this will also be shakey text<2>this will be wavey text<0> this will be normal text

Levels:
- Level name is always under
- Room Files 
Put room under folder of level name they belond to i.e Levels/start_level/room.txt
For simplicity, start room is ALWAYS Base_Room and end room is always End_Room

Room File Syntax - pretty standard JSON
{ // always start with { and end with }
  "name": "Base_Room", /// name of level
  "nugget_level": 1,   /// accessor nugget level (can lock and unlock rooms)
  "connected": ["none", "none", "none", "none"], /// Connected rooms to this one ["north", "south", "east", "west"]
  "commands": ["welcome"],/// accepted commands in this room (keep in lexicographical order for performance reasons)
  "objects": ["nugget"], /// accepted objects in this room (keep in lexicographical order for performance reasons)
  "story": "Description" /// description of the room 
}

Objects: 
Name of the files is the name of the object

{ // always begin with { and end with }
	"start_level": { /// name of the level interaction
		"Base_Room": { /// Room of the interaction
			/// Just an initializer for the start state (alternative states will be a new object)
			/// i.e bottle != broken_bottle (will be another object)
			"state": "default"

			/// different commands - depending on nugget level can interact differently
			/// ["nuggetlevel1", "nuggetlevel2", "nuggetlevel3", "nuggetLevel4", "nuggetlevel5"]
			"welcome": ["you welcome the nugget and the nugget welcomes you",
				"", 
				"", 
				"",
				""
				],

			/// special commands -- start with name of special function i.e play music
			/// follow with name of assett to use followed by a desciption (if any)
			/// separate all fields with :
			"eat": "[play_music:spoopy_music.wav:DESCRIPTION", "", "", "", ""]

			/// move_room - the object forces a room change
			/// if no description (don't include last ':') will simply display the room description 
			"inspect": ["move_room:room_name:DESCRIPTION", "", "", "", ""],

			/// change is changing the state
			"example": [ "change:half_eaten:DESCRIPTION", "", "", "", ""],

			/// conditional - will only display the description if conditions are met
			/// can have multiple conditions
			"example2": [ "conditional:obj_name:condition:obj_2_name:condition2:DESCRIPTION",
					"",
					"",
					"", 
					""]
