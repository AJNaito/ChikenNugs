World file has a list of all possible commands that will be used
FOR ALL FILES - DO NOT PUT COMMENTS IN THEM (///)

Always label fields with ""

Levels:
- Level name is always under
- Room Files 
Put room under folder of level name they belond to i.e Levels/start_level/room.txt
For simplicity, start room is ALWAYS Base_Room and end room is always End_Room

Room File Syntax - pretty standard JSON

  "name": "Base_Room", /// name of level
  "nugget_level": 1,   /// accessor nugget level (can lock and unlock rooms)
  "connected": ["none", "none", "none", "none"], /// Connected rooms to this one ["north", "south", "east", "west"]
  "commands": ["welcome"],/// accepted commands in this room (keep in lexicographical order for performance reasons)
  "objects": ["nugget"], /// accepted objects in this room (keep in lexicographical order for performance reasons)
  "story": "Description" /// description of the room 
}

Objects: 
Name of the files is the name of the object

{ // always begin with { and end with }
	"start_level": { /// name of the level interaction
		"Base_Room": { /// Room of the interaction
			/// different commands - depending on nugget level can interact differently
			/// ["nuggetlevel1", "nuggetlevel2", "nuggetlevel3", "nuggetLevel4", "nuggetlevel5"]
			"welcome": ["you welcome the nugget and the nugget welcomes you",
				"",
