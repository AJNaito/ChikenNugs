	"story":"An endless sea of purple sand unfurled - <3>a wastes<0>,
\nA sight so vast, it takes your breath away.
\nA barren land that stretches 'cross the world,
\nAs far as eye can see, be it night or day.
\n
\nThe <3>sand<0>, it <2>flows<0> like water through your toes,
\nAnd feels so gritty, yet so smooth to touch.
\nThe sky above is white, a pallid manteau,
\nA sign, perhaps, of devastation's clutch.
\n
\nA distant <3>potato<0> <2>floats<0> aimless, devout,
\nA beacon in this wasteland, one of a kind.
\nAnd close is a <3>signpost<0>, tall and proud,
\nA lingering memory of what's left behind.
\n
\nLooking around, ye cannot now deem,
\nWhere what one doth seeks now remains.
\nPerhaps, just maybe, right past the seam,
\n<6>Lays the key to loosen your chains!<0>"
