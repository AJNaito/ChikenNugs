	"story":  "In the heart of a sweet forest's sugary glade,
\nThus rests a clearing, a magical space.
\nWhere chocolate <3>dirt<0> gives birth to candy <3>cane<0> shade,
\nAnd great giants <5>waltz<0> with odd, crooked grace.
\n
\n<3>Joe<0>, <3>Jill<0>, and <3>Jim<0>, three Jolly Rancher friends,
\nAre captive audience to a floating <3>flute<0>'s trance.
\nWith bulging pink eyes, smiles stretched end-to-end,
\nPresent a campfire their goofy, gallant dance.
\n
\nA <3>cauldron<0> sits atop the flickering pyre,
\nBrewing a concoction of various sweets.
\nIts <2>aroma spreading,<0> a scent to admire,
\nAlluring one and all, to veritable treats!
\n
\nPerhaps in this mysterious, delectable land,
\nHides the next piece in your peculiar trials?
\nLook around, perhaps, or join the merry band,
\n<2>Get groovy, get down, go wild and freestyle!<0>
