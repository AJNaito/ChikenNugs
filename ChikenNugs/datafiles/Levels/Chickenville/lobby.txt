	"story": "Amidst a fast-food diner <3>lobby<0>, oddities reign,
\nWhere claw-lickin' delights bring curious gain,
\nHuman feet and toes, a bold new taste,
\nIn signature brain batter, to savor post-haste!
\n
\nTheir logo stands out, a symbol of <1>hype<0>,
\nColonel Cluck's head upon a bright-blue stripe,
\nCurious creatures make their way inside,
\nBeneath <3>skulls<0> hanging high, a macabre pride.
\n
\nDark blue <3>walls<0> with white stripes in the center,
\nTables scattered around, in need of a cleanser.
\nA dog named <3>Bert's<0> upright at the counter,
\nAnd upside-down is <3>Pug<0>, a strange sight to encounter.
\n
\nAn <3>octopus<0>, at a table to the left,
\nEnjoys a meal, with flavors bereft,
\nIn this fast-food diner, a world brand anew,
\nThere doth <7>hides<0> something, that you seek to chew.
