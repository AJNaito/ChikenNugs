  "story": "First, you take careful note of your surroundings,
\nSpawned at the center of a simple, familiar <3>room<0>!
\nA barren studio apartment, though with leviathan furnishings
\nAs you stand at the height of a gnome!
\n
\nSimple green paint strikes towering walls,
\n<3>Cupboards<0> stretch, atop a maple-rugged floor.
\nTrotting around, you can confirm there’s no halls
\nYet one end of the room presents an iron-clad <3>door<0>!
\n
\nAcross from the door is but a nice, homely kitchen,
\nBearing a <3>fridge<0>, <3>microwave<0> and glass-protected <3>stove<0>.
\nAnd off to the side, somewhat out of place in this den,
\nIs an oversized <3>chest<0>, nestled neat in an alcove!
n
\nThe room’s centerpiece: a mahogany <3>desk<0>, 
\nFar too tall to ascend, climb or conquer!
\nIts size, like the rest, is simply elephant-esque,
\nIf only you were simply just slightly taller!
