  "story": "First, you take careful note of your surroundings,
\nSpawned at the center of a simple, familiar home!
\nA barren studio apartment, though with leviathan furnishings
\nAs you stand at the height of a gnome!
\n
\nSimple green paint strikes towering walls,
\nCupboards stretch, atop a maple-rugged floor.
\nTrotting around, you can confirm there’s no halls
\nYet one end of the room presents an iron-clad door!

\nAcross from the door is but a nice, homely kitchen,
\nBearing a fridge, microwave and glass-protected stove.
\nAnd off to the side, somewhat out of place in this den,
\nIs an oversized chest, nestled neat in an alcove!

\nThe room’s centerpiece: a mahogany desk, 
\nFar too tall to ascend, climb or conquer!
\nIts size, like the rest, is simply elephant-esque,
\nIf only you were simply just slightly taller!
